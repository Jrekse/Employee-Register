# Employee-Register
This project was designed around the command line again, the purpose of the app is to give the user the ablity to add team members to a webpage. the prompts will ask you for the job of the employee and ask several questions about the current employee. you can add many cards and when you finish the prompt they will populate to the webpage generated in the main directory. the index.html in dist is an example of a generated page (during walkthrough)
